# Cursor Rules for AgentBeats OpenAgentSafety Integration

## Virtual Environment Activation
Always activate the virtual environment before running any Python scripts or installing packages in this project.

### Python Environment Setup
- This project uses Poetry for dependency management
- Virtual environment is located at `.venv/` in the project root
- Always activate the virtual environment before executing Python commands

### Required Commands for Python Operations
When running Python scripts or installing packages, always prefix commands with virtual environment activation:

```bash
# For running Python scripts
source .venv/bin/activate && python script.py

# For installing packages with pip
source .venv/bin/activate && pip install package_name

# For Poetry operations (preferred method)
poetry install
poetry add package_name
poetry run python script.py

# For running tests
source .venv/bin/activate && python -m pytest
```

### Project Structure Context
- Main Python source code is in `src/agentbeats/`
- Backend API code is in `src/backend/`
- Test files are in the root directory (`test_*.py`)
- This is an AgentBeats SDK project for building security-contest AI agents

### Development Guidelines
- Always use the virtual environment for Python operations
- Use Poetry for dependency management when possible
- Ensure all Python scripts are run within the activated virtual environment
- Check that dependencies are installed in the virtual environment, not globally

### Common Operations
- **Running tests**: `source .venv/bin/activate && python test_integration.py`
- **Installing dependencies**: `poetry install`
- **Running the CLI**: `source .venv/bin/activate && agentbeats --help`
- **Development setup**: `source .venv/bin/activate && python -m agentbeats`

Remember: Never run Python commands without activating the virtual environment first!
